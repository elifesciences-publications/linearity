1. Linear transform the measures: Didn't work so well.
2. Fits, Onset time: Done for Gabazine case.
    2.1 Pruning/Flagging the ill-fits and saving the good ones.
    2.2 Control case fits. Use Gabazine?
    2.3 Baselines have to be changed?
3. Average plots without the cut slices.
4. Photodiode flag. 
5. Baseline flag? 





##
Color the onset time, and g_max for the gabzine fits, and draw the two PSPs for the control case to see the different variables along with the actual control data.

## Model sensitivity to each parameter.
