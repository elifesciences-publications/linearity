Figure 1 

b, e patch electrode at CA3? Scale (16u). Put a patch electrode in b,c,e,h to drive home the point about the electrode.

i) For entire population.
h) Time scale bar, maybe shift or repeat.

Figure 2

1. Show balance, more than just proportionality.

e.) Is there a consistent dip across the 2 and 3 inputs.
All scatters on top of each other?

d and e) Maybe all squares responses with different colors.

Figure 3

e) Units.

g) What's with the supralinear point?

=> Current clamp schematic. Patch electrode.

Discussion point: We urge future studies to similarily isolate inputs and study the summation

supp,do another distribution for gamma
where beta is not free


BIC(DI) - BIC(DN)
. x2(DI) - x2(DN)
Dont put e,f,g DI or DN in bracket. It can have a different connotation.


Meaning of gamma is not very clear. Intuitive meaning. Can we show what something like lower gamma means more normalization. High gamma is no normalization.

Pairwise test in fig5 C.
Gamma looks like Y.


fig6
I/E ratio not mentioned anywhere yet
E - model(legend) 
F - experiment
 
J and K , clarify the manipulation
Think about another way to make the point that both are needed
Units should be same in e and f
Can e and f be overlapping?


fig 7
draw a line through the traces
Put square color scheme

Variance of peak time as a function of expected.

MI for timing gain as a function of the expected.

###############
What do different P's mean and different delay function.
